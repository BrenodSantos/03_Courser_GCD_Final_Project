# 03_Coursera_GCD_Final_Project
This repo is about the final project of the Getting and Cleaning Data from Coursera's Data Science Specialization

In the "run_analysis.R" file, the following is made to get the results in tidy.txt:

-> Once you set your working directory, the dataset will be downloaded if there's not there already
-> Since we will with the activities and features, we need to load it, either 
-> There are training and testing datasets with meaningful columns for this analysis (mean and standard deviation) which will be loaded into R 
-> Once you have worked on each dataset, it will merge both together
-> Tranform the meaningful identifiers into factors
-> For each identifiers set, brings the average value for each variable.]
